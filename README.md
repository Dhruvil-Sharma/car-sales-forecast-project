# Interactive Sales & KPI Forecasting Dashboard

This project delivers a comprehensive forecasting dashboard designed to help a car dealership with strategic planning and decision-making. The application uses historical sales data to predict future KPIs, analyzes the relationships between different business metrics, and provides an interactive tool to simulate "what-if" scenarios.

### ‚ú® Key Features

-   **3-Month KPI Forecasting:** Utilizes a SARIMAX time-series model to predict all business KPIs for the next three months.
-   **Interactive "What-If" Scenarios:** A key feature of the dashboard is a control panel that allows users to adjust the forecast for any single KPI (e.g., increase new car sales by 15%).
-   **Automatic Impact Analysis:** When a "what-if" scenario is created, the dashboard instantly calculates and displays the ripple effect on the Top 10 most correlated KPIs, showing the full impact of a business decision.
-   **Dynamic Visualizations:** The dashboard features a clean, interactive chart built with Plotly to explore both historical data and the adjusted forecasts.

### üî¨ Data Analysis & Modeling

The project followed a structured data science workflow, detailed in the `project_main.ipynb` notebook:

1.  **Data Cleaning:** The raw data was extensively cleaned by imputing missing values, standardizing hundreds of KPI names to merge duplicates, and removing low-information (all-zero) columns.
2.  **Forecasting Model:** A SARIMAX model was chosen for its ability to handle the strong seasonality present in the sales data. A separate model was trained for each KPI.
